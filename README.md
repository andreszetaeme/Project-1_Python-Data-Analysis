# Bakery Exhibition: Digital Marketing Analysis
This is the main read me file which contains all the information about the analysis I did for a client.

There is one ipynb file attached to the repository which contains the code and process used to help this client with her requests to understand the performance of the Bakery Exhibition she was running.

1. Language: Python / Jupyter Notebook

2. Data Source: Google Analytics and Google Ads

3. Client: Paris Bakery Event - Specifically, the online ticket sales department

**Because of confidentiality, I will not display client's real brand. Also, the landing pages and keywords have been modified to not show real client's brand.**

4. Client Request: Find out which channel performance is better, so that they can focus on it for the last sales period.

You can find the ipynb file [here](https://github.com/andreszetaeme/Project-1_Python-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Bakery_Fest_Digital_Marketing_Analysis.ipynb)
There you will find all the process used to fulfill the client's request
